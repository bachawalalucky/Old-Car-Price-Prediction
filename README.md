# Used-Cars-price-Prediction


**So called Second hand's car have a huge market base. Many consider to buy a Used Car instead of buying of new one, as it's is feasible and a better investment.
The main reason for this huge market is that when you buy a New Car and sale it just another day without any default on it, the price of car reduces by 30%.
There are also many frauds in the market who not only sale wrong but also they could mislead to wrong price.
So, here I used this following dataset to predict the price of any used car depending on there features.
Weâ€™ll use a dataset which was provided by the Board Infinity comprised of 15157 rows    with 8 columns.**

**The dataset is broken into 11902 records for training and 2976 for testing. The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen data. The competition is evaluated using mse, R2, Adjusted R2.**
